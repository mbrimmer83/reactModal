## React and Flux pattern exercise
The goal of this project was to use React and Flux patterns to create a daily planner application. The user 
would be able to select from a list of times and a modal would open so the user could input their name and 
number. After the changes were made the timeslot would turn red.

## Learning Outcomes
I learned alot about the structure of components and how it is useful to make them as dumb/simple as possible. I also now
understand the benefits of compartmentalizing small segments of code and refactoring code to further simplify it. Webpack 
was also a new technology I had never used. I built and used a store for this application. I began to 
learn about how dispatchers link actions with stores and the components.

## Problems and future learning goals
I want to fully understand how the dispatcher handles the actions that a component fires off. I had some problems with
how I set states and then use those states across components. I have never ES6 and want to spend some time learning
all of the new features that is offers. My modal would not open and I belive this was do to my current understanding of
how states work across components. I have never used JSX and most code examples were using JSX. I just kinda mixed html and JSX in the app and would love to dig deeper into JSX in order to really understand the differences.
